## Overview

Application that tracks books that are significant to the user and recommends new books to them. Late features will include a creation option as well as deletion.
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started

1. Create repo and clone down starter files from template, or create fresh repo and create basic server file.
2. `npm install`.
3. Link repo to Netlify for deployed site.

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

React, React-Bootstrap, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Axios
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log

07-31-2022 7:00pm - Carousel feature is rendered on page.  Shows stored books and their relevant data.

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Team Agreement

### Logistics

1. Hours available:
    * 9 - 6pm (PST)
2. What platforms will be used for communication?
    * Slack and Remo
3. How often will you take breaks?
    * On the hour / as needed.
4. What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
    * Meet together to find roadblocks and call for TA help.

### Cooperative

1. Make a list of each person's strengths:
    * A.J. :
        * Debugging
    * Hayden:
        * Clear view of big picture requirements and organization.
2. How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your app?
    * A.J. can double check for syntax errors and bugs in general, and Hayden can overview overall component functionality.
3. In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
    * A.J. : Knowledge of code
    * Hayden : Debugging
4. Knowing that all team members need to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
    * When pushing, revisit code and describe functionality to each other.

### Conflict Resolution

1. What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight?
    * Just straightforward communication if someone is falling behind on tasks.
2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
    * Mostly dividing up tasks and ensuring that we're learning from each other.
3. How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
    * Referring back to talking through merges together, we'll ensure that both of members understand what the code is doing so that no one is left behind.
